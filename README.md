## Selected Research Projects
- Applying Deep Learning to Drug Discovery
  - [Our publication in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.3c01471), for the first time, discovered a novel small molecule ligand for WDR91 by using affinity-mediated DNA-encoded chemical library selection followed by deep learning. WDRs’unique β-propeller structure makes them attractive targets, but most human WDRs are unexplored compared to other major drug target families. The discovery of a drug-like small molecule and its covalent analog compounds will soon enable researchers to identify a WDR91 drug candidate.
- Studying secure communication from information theoretic perspective
  - [Our publication in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5238755) provided new insights into secure communication over broadcast channels by developing both inner and outer bounds for the rate equivocation region.
