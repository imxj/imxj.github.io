  - I was a ML researcher at [Google Research](https://research.google/people/107672/) ([see selected research projects](#selected-research-projects) below)

### Education
- Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Syracuse University, 2009
- M.S. in Computer Science, Chinese Academy of Science, Institute of Automation, 2005
- B.S. in Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, 2002

### Selected Research Projects
- Developing General AI Agents with Gemini Multimodality
  - Leveraged [Langfun](https://github.com/google/langfun) and Gemini's multimodal capabilities to build a general-purpose AI agent, achieving SOTA performance on the [GAIA benchmark](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard) in December 2024. This project demonstrated the effectiveness of Langfun + Gemini for complex reasoning and task completion across diverse domains.
  - Adapted the general-purpose AI agent idea to create a specialized vision-only AI agent for automated proofreading of large-scale 3D neuron reconstructions in mouse brain microscopy datasets on [neuroglancer](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/).

- Applying Deep Learning to Drug Discovery
  - [Our publication in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.3c01471), for the first time, discovered a novel small molecule ligand for WDR91 by using affinity-mediated DNA-encoded chemical library selection followed by deep learning. WDR's unique β-propeller structure makes them attractive targets, but most human WDRs are unexplored compared to other major drug target families. The discovery of a drug-like small molecule and its covalent analog compounds will soon enable researchers to identify a WDR91 drug candidate.

- Studying secure communication from information theoretic perspective
  - [Our publication in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5238755) provided new insights into secure communication over broadcast channels by developing both inner and outer bounds for the rate equivocation region.
