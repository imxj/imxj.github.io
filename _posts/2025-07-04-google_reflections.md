I left Google a month ago. While my memory is still fresh, I'd like to reflect on my observations about Google's culture and mindset. This list will be updated continuously.


## "20% project"
Google encourages 20% side projects, though in reality this often means working 120% of your time. You can collaborate with anyone across the company, and everything is transparently accessible - code repositories, design documents, talks, team roadmaps - all searchable through an excellent internal tool. This open culture is a key driver behind Google's tremendous contribution to the last 2 decade's computer science progress. I deeply appreciate this unique environment.

## "Don't panic, we knew it, we can do better"
Google has rock-solid infrastructure and extremely dense talent. So whenever there's pivotal competition, Google's reaction follows a predictable pattern. This has happened repeatedly with recent LLM developments. When ChatGPT emerged, Googlers would say "we originally invented this technique and we have an internal chatbot developed." When DeepSeek launched, the response was "we knew it - nothing DeepSeek discovered is new to us." 
But here's the thing: you're now just following, never leading. I really miss the old days - Gmail completely blowing my mind with 1GB storage, lightning-fast search, and solid spam filtering. Chrome, a revolutionary browser that was way faster and safer than IE. Google Maps, I can navigate the world from my computer for the first time. Those were products that didn't just compete - they redefined!
